# Low Cloud Cover

## Overview
Low cloud cover represents the fraction of the sky covered by clouds with bases below approximately 2 kilometers altitude. These clouds have significant impacts on surface radiation, precipitation, and weather conditions, and are particularly important for aviation and surface visibility.

## Scientific Description
Low clouds include cloud types typically found in the lower troposphere:
- **Stratus (St)**: Gray uniform cloud layer, often producing drizzle
- **Stratocumulus (Sc)**: Lumpy low clouds in patches or layers
- **Cumulus (Cu)**: Detached clouds with vertical development
- **Cumulonimbus (Cb)**: Towering clouds with strong convection (base low, top high)

Height criterion: Cloud base below ~2 km (varies slightly by definition)

## Units
- Fraction (0-1) or Percent (0-100%)

## Applications
- Surface solar radiation (strong blocking effect)
- Fog formation and visibility
- Aviation safety (ceiling height)
- Precipitation (warm rain processes)
- Climate feedbacks (low clouds cool the surface)
- Marine boundary layer studies

## Climate Significance
Low cloud feedback is a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Subtropical stratocumulus decks have strong cooling effect; their response to warming is uncertain and could amplify or dampen climate change.
