# Medium Cloud Cover

## Overview
Medium (or mid-level) cloud cover represents the fraction of the sky covered by clouds with bases between approximately 2 and 6 kilometers altitude. These clouds play an important role in atmospheric radiation and are often associated with frontal systems and widespread precipitation.

## Scientific Description
Medium-level clouds include:
- **Altocumulus (Ac)**: White or gray patches/layers, often wavelike
- **Altostratus (As)**: Gray or blue-gray cloud sheet, often preceding warm fronts
- **Nimbostratus (Ns)**: Dark gray layer producing continuous precipitation (may extend into low levels)

Height range: Cloud base typically 2-6 km in mid-latitudes (varies with latitude and season)

## Units
- Fraction (0-1) or Percent (0-100%)

## Applications
- Frontal weather systems identification
- Mid-level moisture transport
- Radiation balance (both solar and thermal effects)
- Aviation (moderate icing levels)
- Precipitation systems (stratiform rain)

## Physical Characteristics
Mid-level clouds form where:
- Sufficient moisture at 700-400 hPa levels
- Large-scale ascent (fronts, terrain, convergence)
- Temperature typically -10°C to -40°C (mixed-phase clouds)
