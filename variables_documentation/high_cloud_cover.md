# High Cloud Cover

## Overview
High cloud cover represents the fraction of the sky covered by clouds with bases above approximately 6 kilometers altitude. These ice clouds have important radiative effects, trapping outgoing longwave radiation and potentially warming the Earth-atmosphere system.

## Scientific Description
High clouds are composed entirely of ice crystals and include:
- **Cirrus (Ci)**: Delicate fibrous or hairlike ice clouds
- **Cirrostratus (Cs)**: Transparent whitish veil, often producing halos
- **Cirrocumulus (Cc)**: Small white patches or layers (relatively rare)
- **Anvil clouds**: Upper portions of cumulonimbus extending into upper troposphere

Height criterion: Cloud base above ~6 km in mid-latitudes (above ~10 km in tropics, ~3-5 km in polar regions)

## Units
- Fraction (0-1) or Percent (0-100%)

## Applications
- Greenhouse effect (trap longwave radiation)
- Climate feedbacks (high cloud feedback uncertain)
- Aviation (contrails are artificial cirrus, jet stream level)
- Tropical convection indicators (deep convective outflow)
- Upper troposphere moisture studies

## Radiative Effects
High clouds have net warming effect because:
- Minimal impact on incoming solar (thin, high albedo of surface below)
- Strong impact on outgoing longwave (cold cloud tops emit less)
- Net effect: Trapping of Earth's radiation exceeds solar reflection

## Cloud-Climate Feedback
High cloud response to warming is major uncertainty:
- Altitude change affects emission temperature
- Amount and optical properties may change
- Currently one of largest uncertainties in climate sensitivity
