# Mean Surface Downward Long Wave Radiation Flux

## Overview
Mean surface downward longwave radiation flux represents the thermal infrared radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds toward the Earth's surface. This is a key component of the greenhouse effect, returning energy to the surface and warming it beyond what solar radiation alone would achieve.

## Scientific Description
Downward longwave radiation (LW↓) originates from:

1. **Atmospheric gases**: Emission from greenhouse gases
   - Water vapor (H₂O): Dominant contributor (varies 70-90%)
   - Carbon dioxide (CO₂): ~25% contribution
   - Methane (CH₄), ozone (O₃), etc.: Smaller contributions

2. **Clouds**: Emit nearly as blackbodies at cloud temperature
   - Low clouds: Warmer → more emission
   - High clouds: Colder → less emission (but still enhance LW↓ vs. clear sky)

Emission follows radiative transfer through atmosphere, integrating contributions from all levels weighted by:
- Temperature (T⁴ dependence)
- Emissivity (depends on gas concentrations)
- Atmospheric path

Clear-sky LW↓: 200-400 W m⁻² (depends on temperature, humidity)
Cloudy-sky LW↓: 300-450 W m⁻² (clouds enhance by 50-150 W m⁻²)

## Units
- Joules per square metre (J m⁻²) for accumulations
- Watts per square metre (W m⁻²) for flux
- Typical values: 250-450 W m⁻²

## Applications
- **Greenhouse effect quantification**: Direct measure of atmospheric warming
- **Nocturnal cooling**: LW↓ reduces radiative cooling at night
- **Frost forecasting**: Low LW↓ (clear, dry) → frost risk
- **Building energy**: Affects heating/cooling loads
- **Climate change**: Increases with greenhouse gas concentrations
- **Surface temperature**: Critical for energy balance

## Related Variables
- surface_net_thermal_radiation: LW↓ - LW↑
- 2m_temperature: Affects atmospheric emission
- 2m_dewpoint_temperature: Water vapor is dominant greenhouse gas
- total_cloud_cover: Clouds greatly enhance LW↓

## Geographic/Temporal Patterns
**Spatial**:
- Tropics: High (300-400 W m⁻²) - warm, moist atmosphere
- Subtropics: Moderate-high (250-350 W m⁻²)
- Mid-latitudes: Variable (200-350 W m⁻²)
- Polar: Low (150-250 W m⁻²) - cold, dry atmosphere

**Temporal**:
- Warmer seasons: Higher LW↓
- Moist conditions: Higher LW↓
- Cloudy: Higher LW↓ (+50-150 W m⁻²)
- 24-hour: Continuous (unlike solar)

## Climate Change
Expected increases in LW↓ due to:
- Warmer atmosphere (T⁴ emission)
- Increased water vapor (Clausius-Clapeyron)
- CO₂ increase (enhanced greenhouse effect)
- Cloud feedback (uncertain sign)

Observed trends: +1-3 W m⁻² per decade in recent decades
